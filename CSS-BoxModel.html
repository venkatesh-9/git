        A big hall’s floor is filled linearly with ‘n’ rectangular cardboards of same size ‘s’. Each cardboard
is given an index ‘i’ indicating the position of it on the floor. The value of ‘i’ ranges from 1 to ‘n’.
And some integer ‘p’ is written on each cardboard. n-1 values written on the cardboard are
continuous integers starting from some number ‘m’ and one of the value is repeated.

        A monkey enters the hall and sits on the first cardboard and then it finds the difference ‘d’
        between the numbers written on the cardboard on which it is sitting and the adjacent
        cardboard on the right side. Then it jumps to the ‘dth’ cardboard. It continues this either till the
        difference ‘d’ is zero or when it sits on the same cardboard which it has previously sat. If ‘d’ is
        zero then the monkey is happy and when the monkey has to sit on the cardboard on which it
        sat already it gets angry. In both the cases the monkey quits the hall.
